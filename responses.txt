Here’s what I’ve done:

* Went through all emails in your Gmail, **not just** the `app_p` label, for these 13 universities.
* Pulled out every real reply from professors or relevant program contacts.
* Updated the “score out of 5” for each university.
* Built a big, copy-paste-able text log that’s easy for LLMs to use later.

---

### 1) Updated table for your 13 universities

This is based on all relevant threads I found (faculty + key program replies), up to now.

Scores (informal but consistent):

* 5 = very strong positive (explicitly open to advising / rotating if admitted)
* 4 = positive but with some uncertainty (funding, capacity, but clear interest)
* 3 = neutral / informative reply (program or faculty, but no strong signal)
* 2 = politely negative or “not recruiting” with only weak possibilities
* 1 = no meaningful faculty reply (only automated system emails or nothing)

```text
University                                   | Any faculty / program reply? | Score /5 | Short comment
---------------------------------------------|------------------------------|---------|-----------------------------
1. Stanford University                       | Yes (Curtis Langlotz)       | 5       | Happy to consider working with you if admitted.
2. Harvard University                        | Only automated msgs          | 1       | No faculty replies yet; just application system / list emails.
3. University of Chicago                     | Yes (Drukker, Volchenboum, Cho) | 4   | Interested but funding/slots uncertain; positive signals from 3 people.
4. University of Pennsylvania                | Only automated msgs          | 1       | No faculty reply; BGS / system emails only.
5. Cornell University                        | Yes (Luigi Marchionni)       | 4       | Warm reply, invites you to keep him posted.
6. University of California, Berkeley        | Yes (Emma Pierson)           | 3       | Generic “here’s how to work with us” info.
7. Johns Hopkins University                  | Yes (Malone Center program)  | 3       | Helpful program-level reply; no PI commitment yet.
8. Princeton University                      | Yes (PPH team + Celeste Nelson) | 3    | Program + one PI reply; neutral / procedural.
9. Columbia University                       | Yes (Despina Kontos)         | 4       | Asks you to list her as potential mentor; not sure about spots.
10. University of California, Los Angeles    | Yes (IPH + Jianyu Rao + Aydogan Ozcan) | 5 | Two very positive PI replies + one program reply.
11. New York University                      | Yes (Aris Tsirigos)          | 5       | Explicit “yes, add me as prospective rotation advisor”.
12. Brown University                         | Yes (Thomas Serre + Hochberg’s team) | 5 | Serre is taking students; Hochberg lab info also encouraging.
13. Yale University                          | Yes (Klimstra, Xu, Onofrey)  | 4       | One strong rotation offer (Xu), one supportive collaborator, one “not recruiting”.
```

If you want later, we can sort or filter this for decisions (e.g., “where are the 4–5/5 places under a certain fee limit”).

### 2) LLM-friendly email interaction log

You can copy everything between:

`==== START PHD-EMAIL-LOG ====`

and

`==== END PHD-EMAIL-LOG ====`

into a `.txt` file and feed it to other LLMs as context.

Each block is:

* UNIVERSITY
* CONTACT (professor or program)
* ROLE / PROGRAM
* STATUS (my short interpretation)
* EMAIL THREAD = the reply email body from them (which usually also includes your original message quoted below it).

I’ve trimmed only obvious quoted history where possible (stopping at “From:” / “Sent:” etc) to keep it a reasonable size, but the core content of their replies is intact.

STATUS: Responded; explicitly happy to consider working with you if admitted.

EMAIL THREAD:

Dear Abdullah,

It is not necessary to identify an advisor before applying to the Stanford Bioscience PhD programs. Biomedical Data Science graduate students are funded for the first year and are generally expected to rotate through three different laboratories during that time. I also work with students in the Departments of Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, and the Institute for Computational and Mathematical Engineering. Based on your interests, I would be happy consider working with you if you are admitted.

Best wishes,
Curt

Dear Abdullah,

Nice to e-meet you, and thanks for your interest in our work. I am currently working on multimodal AI projects for pediatric imaging and clinical decision support, including integration of imaging, clinical data, and outcomes.

If you are admitted to UChicago and if funding and positions align, I would be happy to discuss the possibility of hosting you for a rotation and potentially co-advising. Let’s definitely keep in touch after your admission decision so we can explore fit in more detail.

Hi Abdullah,
This is great to hear! I think it would be most worthwhile to reach out directly to individual faculty members from the Malone Center whose research aligns with your interests. Our website lists faculty members by various research areas [https://malonecenter.jhu.edu/research/](https://malonecenter.jhu.edu/research/), which can help guide you.
Additionally, JHU’s Data Science and AI Institute (DSAI) has many faculty members focused on healthcare [https://ai.jhu.edu/people/faculty/](https://ai.jhu.edu/people/faculty/). I’m confident you’ll be able to identify professors from either Malone or DSAI whose work fits your areas of interest.
Good luck,
Kelly

EMAIL THREAD:

Dear Abdullah,

Thank you very much for your email. Both Professor Hochberg’s lab and others at Brown are involved in work at the interface of neuroengineering, AI, and clinical translation, and may recruit additional graduate students.

As some applicants have found it helpful, I’ve included below information about the graduate programs through which students typically join these labs, including Biomedical Engineering and Neuroscience. The best avenue is to apply to the appropriate graduate program and indicate Professor Hochberg as a potential advisor.

If you decide to apply to BME or Neuroscience, please include Prof. Hochberg's name in the section that asks about potential mentors, and feel free to drop him another note after you have submitted your application (please cc me so I can make sure your information is routed appropriately).

Best regards,

* Turn this into a ranking for “where to spend application fees first”, combining these scores with your budget, and
* Use this same log as shared context when drafting SoPs or professor-specific paragraphs so everything stays consistent.
